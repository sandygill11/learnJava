//	In Java, if a class implements an interface, it is expected to implement all the interfaceâ€™s methods.
//
//	However, if the class is declared abstract, it is allowed to leave some or all methods unimplemented.
//
//	The responsibility then passes to the first concrete subclass to implement the remaining methods.
